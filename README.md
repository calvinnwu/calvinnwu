# Hello there! 👋

My name is Calvin, a student at the School of Information and Computer Sciences at UC Irvine. I'm passionate about software engineering, data science, and sports analytics. I have experience 
with programming languages like Python, C++, and Java as well as tools like Git. Through my coursework, I also have a solid understanding of object-oriented programming, discrete structures,
and data structures and algorithms. Currently, I am trying to expand my knowledge and learn how to use front-end technologies like Javascript and React. Interested in collaborating or just want to chat? [Reach out to me!](calvinnwu@gmail.com)

**Fun Fact:** I have triple citizenship!!! 🦅 🍁 🧨
