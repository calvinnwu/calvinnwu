# Hello there! 👋

My name is Calvin, a student at Brown University studying Computer Science. I'm passionate about software engineering, data science, and sports analytics and am searching for any opportunities that can either help me learn new skills or let me display my existing ones. I have experience 
with programming languages like Python, C++, and Java as well as tools like Git. Through my coursework, I also have a solid understanding of object-oriented programming, discrete structures,
and data structures and algorithms. Currently, I am trying to expand my knowledge and learn how to use front-end technologies like Javascript and React. Interested in collaborating or just want to chat? [Reach out to me!](calvinnwu@gmail.com)

**Fun Fact:** I have triple citizenship!!! 🦅 🍁 🧨
